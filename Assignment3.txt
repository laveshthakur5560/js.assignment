Que. Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.
Ans. Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities. Let's discuss each one of them in detail.

1.The String Data Type
    The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:
    Example:- var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; // single quote inside double quotes
              var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
              var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';     // escaping single quote with backslash

2.The Number Data Type
    The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
    Example:- var a = 25;         // integer
              var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
              var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
              var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425

3.The Boolean Data Type
    The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:
    Example:- var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
 
              alert(b > a) // Output: true
              alert(b > c) // Output: false

4.The Undefined Data Type
    The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
    Example:- var a;
              var b = "Hello World!"
 
              alert(a) // Output: undefined
              alert(b) // Output: Hello World!

5.The Null Data Type
    This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
    A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
    Example:- var a = null;
              alert(a); // Output: null
 
              var b = "Hello World!"
              alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
 
              b = null;
              alert(b) // Output: null

6.The Object Data Type
    The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
    An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
    The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.
    Example:- var emptyObject = {};
              var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};
 
              // For better reading
              var car = {
                            "modal": "BMW X3",
                            "color": "white",
                            "doors": 5
                        }

7.The Array Data Type
    An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
    The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:
    Example:- var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
              var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
              alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
              alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York

8.The Function Data Type
    The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:
    Example:- var greeting = function(){ 
                                        return "Hello World!"; 
                                       }
 
              // Check the type of greeting variable
              alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
              alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!
